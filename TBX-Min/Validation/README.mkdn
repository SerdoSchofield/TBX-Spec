##TBX-Min Validation

There are two directories:

* `schemas` contains the XSD and RNG schemas for validating TBX-Min documents.
* `t` contains tests, written in Perl, that make certain that several document sample documents are validated by the schema.

To run the tests, run `prove -v`. You may need to install some CPAN dependencies first.
